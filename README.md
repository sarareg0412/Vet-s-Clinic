# Vet’s Clinic
## A simulation of a Vet’s Clinic using Discrete Event modeling

Effectively managing a vet’s clinic can be challenging for various reasons linked to the unpredictability of the gravity of a patient. To deal with the intrinsic uncertainties and to try to give the problem a more structured approach, a simulation was designed using the Anylogic tool with the aim of collecting meaningful values for the parameters of interest.

In this repository can be found the code of the model developed.
